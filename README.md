# DS-ML-AI-Study
A Practical Curriculum for Self-Studying into <b>Data Science</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b> &amp; <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>

Here is an opinionated how-to for anyone interested in starting a career in Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence using the vast resources available online. It has been streamlined them into a 2.5 years MSc to PhD programme ideally in a Homeschooled pattern.

I hope it becomes beneficial to someone out there.
